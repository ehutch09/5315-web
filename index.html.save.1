      <h2>What is Docker</h2>
      <p>Docker is an open source software virtualization container platform that was initially released on March 13th 2013. Docker utilize containers to deploy, run, and manage applications for developers allowing for flexibility and portability since the container format keeps the application and code the same no matter what environment it is deployed in. Docker uses Linux and Windows as its operating systems and utilizes Linux kernel functionality to isolate resources and applications creating lightweight images. This container approach allows for the elimination of set-up time and compatibility configuration for developers as the application code is organized and ready to use. The ability to share, test, and deploy work collaboratively is the big benefit of using Docker container software.<br><br/><br>Sources:<br/>
